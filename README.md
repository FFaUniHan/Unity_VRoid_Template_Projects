# Instructions
Once you download and extract the zip file or clone the project to your Git application, open it in Unity Hub. This project uses Unity version 2022.2.17f1, earlier versions of Unity might not work, and later versions might break some of the scripts. To download a specific version of Unity, go to this website https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive. After you download and install the Unity version, you can add this version of Unity back to Unity Hub and open it.

Open the project files that matches your VRM model version: VRM0 or VRM1. It's based on the option you selected when you export your model in VRoid Studio. 

If you want to use your model for VSeeFace, it's recommended to use VRM0 instead. 

Once the project is opened, don't forget to double click the Scene file in the Project Window.
